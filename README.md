# Project-1

This application allows users to quickly and easily get basic information about cities around the world. The user enters the name of the city they wish to search and then selects the correct city from a list possible matches. Once a city is selected, a card is added to the page with basic information about the city including the current time and weather summary and a marker for the city is added to the map and the map centers on the new city. The user can search for more cities and the information cards will be added to the page so that the user can compare the information for multiple cities quickly and on one page. The cards can also be easily removed.

This Project was developed by Gezahegn, David, and Seth. We used the Teleport API, the OpenWeatherMap API, and the Leaflet.js javascript library.
